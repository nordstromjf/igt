  <p>After answering the above questions and seeing the reponses from your classmates, think about how you responded. Did this differ from how your classmates responded? Try to give reasons for how you chose your responses to the above questions. Ask classmates for their reasons for responding as they did. It can be particularly useful to share your answers with someone who chose a different response from you. You can summarize the various reasons for voluteering and not volunteering in the exercises below.</p>

  <exercise>
    <title>Volunteer or not</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        After answering the questions, were you likely to volunteer or unlikely to volunteer? For example, were you likely to be the one to call the power company or get eaten by sharks, or were you generally hoping someone else would do it? If it depended on the situation, explain under what circumstances you were likely to volunteer.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <title>Always a volunteer</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        After sharing your answers as a class, did each situation have a volunteer? In other words, was there always someone willing to call the power company or take fewer points? If there was a question with no volunteer, can you suggest why?

  <exercise>
    <title>Unlikely to volunteer</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
