\begin{enumerate}
\item Give a brief description of the game. Including what it means to ``win" or ``lose" the game.

\item How many players do you need?

\item Do the players have perfect information for the game?

\item Is the game finite or can it go on forever?

\item Give some possible strategies for the player(s). Note, depending on the game, these strategies may not always result in a definite win, but they should suggest a way to increase a player's chances of winning (or not losing).
