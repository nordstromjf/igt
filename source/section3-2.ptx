    In this section we will learn a method for finding the maximin solution for a repeated game using a graph.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's continue to consider the game given in <xref ref="E_smallrepeat"></xref> by
    <me>
      \left[\begin{matrix}1\amp 0\\
      -1\amp 2
      \end{matrix} \right].
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to make our analysis easier, let's name the row and column strategies as in <xref ref="T_smallrepeat"></xref>.

    We want to determine how often Player 1 should play A and how often she should play B.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="E_linearconjecture">
    <title>Conjecture a strategy</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        First it is good to test your instinct. Do you think she should play one of the strategies more often than the other? If so, which strategy should she play the most?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    What we are really trying to find is the probability with which Player 1 plays A (or B). Since we know that the probabilities sum to one, if we can find one probability, then we know the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is one way to do this. Let <m>p</m> be the probability that Player 1 plays B. Let <m>m</m> be the payoff to Player 1. Since we are trying to find a mixed strategy for Player 1, we will pick a strategy for Player 2 and try to determine the possible payoffs for Player 1.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us determine some pairs <m>(p, m)</m>.
  </p>

  <dl>
  <li>
  <title>Step 1.</title>
  <p>
    Assume <em>Player 2</em> plays pure strategy <em>C</em>.
  </p>
</li>
    <li>
      <title>Step 1a.</title>
      <p>
        Find the probability (<m>p</m>) and payoff (<m>m</m>) if Player 1 always plays <em>A</em>.

        If Player 1 plays pure strategy A, then she never plays B. Thus the probability she plays B is 0. Hence,  <m>p=0</m>. 

        In the case where Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays C, what is the payoff to Player 1? This is <m>m</m>, so <m>m=1</m>. 

        Thus, for the strategy pair <m>[A, C]</m> we get <m>(0, 1)</m> for <m>(p, m)</m>. 

        It is important to note that <m>(0, 1)</m> is <em>not</em> a payoff vector. This is common notation for any ordered pair. With payoff vectors, the ordered pair represents the payoff to each player. Here the ordered pair represents a probability of playing B and the payoff to Player 1.
      </p></li>

    <li>
      <title>Step 1b.</title>
      <p>
        Find the probability (<m>p</m>) and payoff (<m>m</m>) if Player 1 always plays <em>B</em>.

        If Player 1 plays pure strategy B, then what is the probability that she plays B? Since she always plays B, <m>p=1</m>. 

        In the case where Player 1 plays B and Player 2 plays C, what is the payoff to Player 1? <m>m=-1</m>. 

        Thus, for the strategy pair <m>[B, C]</m> we get <m>(1, -1)</m> for <m>(p, m)</m>.
      </p></li>

    <li>
      <title>Step 1c.</title>
      <p>
        Now we want to know what Player 1's payoff will be as she varies the probability, <m>p</m>, with which she plays <em>B</em>. We can draw a graph where the <m>x</m>-axis represents to probability with which she plays B (<m>p</m>) and the <m>y</m>-axis represents the expected payoff (<m>m</m>). See <xref ref="F_MixedStrategyAxes"></xref>.

        Thus, when Player 1 plays only A, she is playing B with probability 0; when Player 1 plays only B, she is playing B with probability 1. It might be easier to remember if you label your graph as in <xref ref="F_MixedStrategyAxes"></xref>.

<p>
  Before moving on, let's make sure we understand what this line represents. Any point on it represents the expected payoff to Player 1 as she varies her strategy, <em>assuming Player 2 only plays C</em>. In this case, we can see that as she plays B more often, her expected payoff goes down.
</p>
<p>
  Now let's do the same thing, assuming Player 2 plays only D.
</p>
  <dl>
  <li>
  <title>Step 2.</title>
  <p>
    Assume <em>Player 2</em> plays pure strategy <em>D</em>.
  </p>
</li>
    <li>
      <title>Step 2a.</title>
      <p>
        Find the probability (<m>p</m>) and payoff (<m>m</m>) if Player 1 always plays <em>A</em>.

        If Player 1 plays pure strategy <em>A</em>, then what is the probability that she plays B? <m>p=0</m>. What is the payoff to Player 1? <m>m=0</m>. 

        Thus, for the strategy pair <m>[A, D]</m> we get <m>(0, 0)</m> for <m>(p, m)</m>.
      </p></li>

    <li>
      <title>Step 2b.</title>
      <p>
        Find the probability (<m>p</m>) and payoff (<m>m</m>) if Player 1 always plays <em>B</em>.

        If Player 1 plays pure strategy B, then what is the probability that she plays B? <m>p=1</m>. What is the payoff to Player 1? <m>m=2</m>. 

        Thus, for the strategy pair <m>[B, D]</m> we get <m>(1, 2)</m> for <m>(p, m)</m>.
      </p></li>

    <li>
      <title>Step 2c.</title>
      <p>
        Now, on our same graph from Step 1, we can plot the points we determined in Step 2a and Step 2b. We will connect them with a line representing Player 2's pure strategy D. See <xref ref="F_Player_2_s_pure_strategy_D"></xref>.

        Now we can see that if Player 2 plays only D, then Player 1 does best by playing only B.
      </p></li>
  </dl>
  <p>
    So we have this nice graph, but what does it really tell us? Although we drew lines representing each of Player 2's pure strategies, Player 1 doesn't know what Player 2 will do. Suppose Player 1 only played A, while Player 2 plays an unknown mixed strategy. Then the possible payoffs for Player 1 are 1 or 0. The more often Player 2 plays C, the more often Player 1 gets 1. So the <em>expected payoff</em><idx><h>expected payoff</h></idx> per game for a repeated game varies between 0 and 1. We can see the possible expected values as the red line on the graph in <xref ref="F_BoldA"></xref>.

    Since we want to understand mixed strategies for Player 1, what would happen if Player 1 played A half the time and B half the time? In other words, what happens if <m>p=1/2</m>?

    Hopefully, you've begun to see that for each choice of <m>p</m>, the top line represents the highest expected value for Player 1; the bottom line represents the lowest expected value for Player 1; the area between the lines represents the possible expected values for Player 1. As we did with non-repeated games, let's look at the <q>worst case scenario</q> for Player 1. In other words, let's assume that Player 2 can figure out Player 1's strategy. Then Player 1 would want to <em>maximize the minimum expected value</em>. Aha! This is just looking for the <em>maximin</em> strategy<idx><h>maximin strategy</h><h>repeated games</h></idx>!

    It should be easy to see that the <em>maximum</em> of the minimum expected payoffs occurs at the intersection of the two lines.

        This is the line passing through the points <m>(0, 1)</m> and <m>(1, -1)</m>. It has slope <m>-2</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept 1. Thus, it has equation <m>y=-2x+1</m>. [Although the <m>x</m>-axis represents probability <m>p</m> and the <m>y</m>-axis represents expected payoff <m>m</m>, you are probably more comfortable solving equations<ndash />at least for the moment<ndash />in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.]

      Determine Player 1's maximin mixed strategy<idx><h>maximin mixed strategy</h></idx>. 

      Recalling that the first coordinate is <m>p</m>, the probability that Player 1 plays <em>B</em>, we know that Player 1 will play B with probability 1/4, and thus, play A with probability 3/4 [<m>1-1/4=3/4</m>]. The expected payoff for Player 1 is 1/2. It is important to check back to your original intuition about the game from <xref ref="E_linearconjecture"></xref>. Did it seem as though Player 1 should play A more often than B?
    </p></li>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Let's make a few important observations. First, it should be clear from the graph that Player 1 expects a payoff of 1/2 NO MATTER WHAT PLAYER 2 DOES. Furthermore, since this is a zero-sum game, we know that Player 2's expected payoff is <m>-1/2</m>. It is important to note that this graph does not give us any information about an optimal strategy for Player 2. We will see how to find a strategy for Player 2 in the following exercises. Can you think of how you might do this?
  </p>

  <p>
    We can use the graphical method to find the maximin and minimax mixed strategies for repeated two-person zero-sum games.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using the same game matrix as above:
    <me>
      \left[\begin{matrix}1\amp 0\\
      -1\amp 2
      \end{matrix} \right],
    </me>
    we will continue to label Player 1's strategies by <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, and Player 2's strategies by <m>C</m> and <m>D</m>. We now want to determine the minimax strategy for Player 2. Keep in mind the payoffs are still the payoffs to Player 1, so Player 2 wants the payoff to be as small as possible.

    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    For non-repeated games we have seen that if the maximin value is the same as the minimax value, then the game has a pure strategy equilibrium. The same idea applies to mixed strategy games. If the value of the maximin strategy is the same as the value of the minimax strategy, then the corresponding mixed strategies will be an equilibrium point<idx><h>mixed strategy equilibrium</h></idx><idx><h>equilibrium</h><h>mixed strategy</h></idx>. Thus, your answer to <xref ref="E_payoffssame"></xref> should tell you this game has a mixed strategy equilibrium point consisting of the maximin/ minimax strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now know that Player 2 wants to play the minimax strategy in response to Player 1's maximin strategy, so we need to find the actual mixed strategy for Player 2 to employ. Since we are minimizing Player 1's maximum expected payoff, we will continue to use the matrix representing Player 1's payoff. We will repeat the process we used for Player 1, except the <m>x</m>-axis now represents the probability that Player 2 will play <m>D</m>, and the lines will represent Player 1's strategies <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

    Now it may have occurred to you that since this is a zero-sum game, we could have just converted our matrix to the payoff matrix for Player 2, and found Player 2's maximin strategy. But it is important to understand the relationship between the maximin and the minimax strategies. So for the sake of practice and a little more insight, find Player 2's maximin strategy by writing the payoff matrix for Player 2 and repeating the process that we did for Player 1. Keep in mind that Player 2 is finding the probability of playing <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> rather than <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

        Convert the payoff matrix above into the payoff matrix for Player 2. Find the maximin strategy for Player 2 using the graphical method. Be sure to include a sketch of the graph (labeled!!), the equations for the lines, the probability that Player 2 will play <m>C</m> and <m>D</m>, and the expected payoff for Player 2.
