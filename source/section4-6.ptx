  <title>Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="VDexperiment"></xref> we played a game called Volunteer's Dilemma<idx><h>Volunteer's Dilemma</h></idx>.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="E_VDpoints">
    <title>A Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        One example of a Volunteer's Dilemma is the game where everyone chooses <q>1 point</q> or <q>5 points.</q> If at least one person writes down 1 point, then everyone gets the number of points they wrote down. If no one chooses 1 point, then everyone gets 0 points. Choosing <q>1 point</q> is considered volunteering or cooperating. Choosing to not volunteer and take <q>5 points</q> is defecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should note that it is difficult to put this game into a matrix form since payoffs depend on whether there is at least one volunteer or cooperator.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    In this section we will compare Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma with Volunteer's Dilemma. In particular, we want to think about the effect cooperating and defecting have on the group of players. How does one player's choice affect everyone else? What happens to the group if there is a single cooperator or a single defector? What happens if everyone cooperates or everyone defects? We will use the payoffs for Prisoner's Dilemma from <xref ref="S_CWPD"></xref>, given again in <xref ref="T_CWPD2"></xref>.

    <statement>

  <p>Now that we've considered how an individual decision can affect the group, we can think about what the most rational strategy is in a multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma or a Volunteer's Dilemma.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="E_CWPDcoopordefect">
    <title>Rationality in Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Considering your answers above and to previous work with Prisoner's Dilemma, in <em>Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma</em>, which is more <em>rational</em> to be a cooperator or a defector? Why?

  <exercise xml:id="E_CWPDallrational">
     <title>Everyone is rational in Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
    <statement>
      <p>

  <exercise xml:id="E_classchicken">
    <title>Class-wide Chicken</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Volunteer's Dilemma can also be called <q>Class-wide Chicken.</q> Try to describe this class-wide game in terms of <q>swerving</q> and <q>going straight.</q> How do the payoffs for Volunteer's Dilemma relate to the payoffs for Chicken?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>Even though the Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma and the Volunteer's Dilemma games were played with multiple players, each game was only played once. In the next section we look at what might happen if we repeatedly play Prisoner's Dilemma with the same opponent.</p>
